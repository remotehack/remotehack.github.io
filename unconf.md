    <div>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>An unconference is a conference without predefined topics. There is a high level structure and theme, but actual topics are generated by the participants on the spot, and breakout groups are formed dynamically based on interest and relevance.</p>

        <h3>What kind of topics will we cover</h3>
        <p>Anything that interests you; could talk about a project you like, or a book you‚Äôve read, or a question that you have, or an idea that you want to explore with others. Or meditation sessions, watching videos together, telling jokes, whatever you want.</p>

        <p>The only restriction that we have is that it fits with our Code of Conduct - ie, is respectful of others.</p>

        <h3>When should I show up</h3>
        <p>Join us at the start of the day if you want to propose or help choose sessions, otherwise feel free to drop in anytime</p>

        <h3>What do I need to plan</h3>
        <p>No plans needed, but feel free to think about cool stuff you‚Äôd like to investigate/discuss/talk about</p>
