This was our most AI-centric hackday to date, mainly because we generated candidates for a new remotehack logo, and then proceeded to use exactly none of them. We also probably had more coffee (or at least mentions thereof) than any other hackday, so lemme just ask ChatGPT if those things are correlated.

```
ChatGPT
Coffee consumption is not directly correlated with using AI for tasks, although some individuals may use coffee to help them stay alert while working on AI-related activities.

User
and is that because it's inherently boring to work on tasks like that?

ChatGPT
No, the use of coffee to stay alert while working on AI-related tasks is not necessarily because those tasks are inherently boring, but rather because they can be mentally demanding and require sustained focus.

User
yeah, good save

ChatGPT
Thank you! If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!

## Things people did

-   **Ben** was recording some screens and got a few steers on how best to use APIs to save stuff to the device...we did _not_ succeed in getting a recording of anybody interviewing ChatGPT, but not for lack of trying.

-   **Ryan** finally successfully convinced Adam to get a NetGear mesh router, and it's the best thing that ever happened to anybody. There _had_ been lots of talk about testing out pulumi + fly.io, but to anybody's knowledge, that did not in fact materialise.

-   **Adam** accidentally created a thread with the wrong name, but nobody noticed anyway, so no harm done. He also inducted Hugh into the world of elite level hacking by pasting an `nmap` command from the internet...oh, and then later continued building out the feeling slo webapp.

-   **Hugh** and **Tom** may have done some watering of plants, and then potentially broke stuff, but I don't remember, so I decided to be lazy and use the PR discussion to prompt Hugh to just write what they did, lulz. Turns out, they didn't have time to tell me what they did, so I will offer to approve any PRs that retroactively update this point in the recap.
