The Summer Hack of our Discontent...

This one was very quiet, and the majority of the chat in the discord was about what people _weren't_ going to do.

## Things people did

- **Ryan** was busy indulgin in his babyccino, so he was out for the day.

- **Ben** continued hacking on the https://stacks.camera/ sideproject, but didn't drop any updates on how it went...tsk tsk.

- **Pete** did a bunch of physical hacks, which definitely count, and also was deobfuscating some, airquotes sus javascript airquotes.

- **Adam** tried to do some actual video recording, but then the kids wanted to _do stuff_, so they all did that instead. He closed out the day with some actual hacks, putting a recursive file structure into a tar archive and base64 encoding it in a configmap*

\* - This did not in any way work, and he ended up binning the whole thing.
