### Things people did

- **Alan & Mike** built a web app that lets you listen to Spotify together with friends. It has incredible integration using the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). And, very importantly, supports dark mode. [ðŸŽµ][ep4]

- **Saul** worked on a [space-invaders style game](https://github.com/saulwiggin/aliens-go-home) using React & svg, using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for login, and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for storing a highscore list. Very fun (and difficult!) [ðŸŽµ][ep7]

- **Dag** added live github notifications and looked into [automatically triaging issues](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/30) using github actions! He told us about useful sites & tools: [comeover.io](https://comeover.io/home) â€“ for watching "non-netflix" videos, [smee.io](https://smee.io/) â€“ for developing webhook handlers & [probot](https://probot.github.io/) â€“ for automating github tasks. [ðŸŽµ][ep2]

- **Pete** looked into code diffing and compiled [a list of instances where github generated diffs weren't too great](https://github.com/peterjwest/git-diff/compare/test). In a calm/heroic/unstoppable coding session wrote [a script](https://github.com/peterjwest/git-diff/blob/master/diff.js) that resolved those issues. [ðŸŽµ][ep9]

- **Dan** checked out the danceability of music tracks using Spotify [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) api, and wondered about if this could be used to analyse festival line-ups! He took us through some example responses, and discussed some of the different properties and their distributions. Fascinating stuff! [ðŸŽµ][ep5]

- **Adam & Ben** are now big-fish publishing executives with their new hit-podcast "[AirQuotes The Podcast AirQuotes](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ppoyoTxxSv9IvRGGqLWP7?si=92Gu71ncRlqLN-QYJl-hwQ)" [ðŸŽµ][ep1]. Creating the finest [organic & hand-rolled xml](https://remotehack.space/live/feed), they found [cast-feed-validator](https://castfeedvalidator.com/?url=https://remotehack.space/live/feed.xml) useful and recorded episodes straight from zoom. Feedback from listeners:

  - "It's weird how professional this looks" â€“ Pete
  - "Have you thought about being on YouTube, or maybe the TV?" â€“ Dan

- **Gabor** bbq'd up some apples [ðŸŽµ][ep6].

- **Ryan** spent the day Birthdaying ðŸŽ‰
