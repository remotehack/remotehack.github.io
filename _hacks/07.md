### Things people did

- **Ben** started in a tent and then was guided through the hills and dales via zoom call audio and google maps interpretation by the other attendees. He also partook in the facilities of Ryan's kitchen.
- **Panda** hacked on some hardware and figured out how to sally forth and solder on with a temperature sensor sending data over the wire.
- **Ryan** continued working on the super awesome app to help people remind themselves of the awesome stuff they've done.
- **Adam** created a repo with ideas of things to do with a corpus of javascript functions, and even got a PR merged to one of Panda's repos...plus messed around with generating parsons problems from github source code.
