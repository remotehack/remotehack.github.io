The hackday was all about going back to Bassics, which is the best bass guitar joke Adam could come up with. The best bass guitar jokes that the LLM's came up with were so embarrassingly not even jokes that I won't repeat them here.

...Ryan now has a bass guitar is what I'm saying.

## Things people did

- **Ryan** got a bass guitar, as mentioned, and discussed his approaches to practising it, which were very interesting, and not unlike a distributed, async system.

- **Adam** was going to hack, but then had to make lunch and go downtown, but near the end of the day got the yaml config for his Tailscale Remotelab Admin project into GitHub.

- **Jacob** got some good input about extracting colours from an image, but the discord has scant evidence of whether he actually got anything updated with it.

- **Pete** gave some good input about extracting colours from an image, but the discord has scant evidence of whether anything got updated with it.

- **Panda** also had some tips on colour stuff...and now I'm thinking I should have written a different blurb above about colours.

- **Hugh** successfully sent some messages over a reticulum mesh network, and then helpfully wrote that so I could put it in the summary.

- **Joe** was sorting food, and then be'd right back.

- **Tom** reappearred from a long Hackday hiatus, and wrote a software rasterizer in Rust and I got perspective projection and camera transforms working
