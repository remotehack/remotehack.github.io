### Things people did

– **Gabor** hacked on alternative encodings for web APIs, generated a whole load of json data, and compared different methods for encoding/compressing it. He _may_ have run PHP within JavaScript using Web Assembly?
– **Ben** wrote a binary encoding using emoji, and made a webpage Ryan's bike hacks.
– **Mike** – probably tried to get his plumber to invest in his and Alans Spotify app :money_with_wings:
– **Adam** built a Micromaterial on git-submodules, trademarked the term "ChillHacksing", and built an awesome list of other micromaterials. 
- **Ryan** built a web view of his Wahoo Kickr indoor bike trainer's data, using the Web Bluetooth APIs and a bit of exercise.
