### This was a Code Retreat ðŸ¥³

We met up and did a few katas, pair-programming and doing test-driven-development. The day was really fun, and provoked some interesting discussions around approaches and what felt nice. We also leaned heavily in Sveta's knowledge of array streams in Java ðŸ™Œ.

We used Game of Life for each session:

- Session 1: All together, solving Game of Life on paper & experimenting with TDD.

- Session 2: In pairs doing TDD ping-pong. The constraint was "subversive developer". One person writes the best tests, and the other tries to write the worst code that passes those tests.

- Session 3: In pairs doing driver/navigator ("strong style"). The constraint was to have no mutable state.

- Session 4: In pairs doing driver/navigator, no conditionals.

- Session 5: Mob programming with one driver. The constraint was to have no variables in any of our code (including tests).
