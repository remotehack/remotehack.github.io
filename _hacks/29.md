This hackday saw great success on CI for the hack itself. We got no update on the previous hack where Ryan may or may not have created a self-aware espresso machine that now controls his house. We also had some non-tech hacks, which is totally cool. We also saw some chat on the demise of Heroku and how everybody now has to move the stuff they forgot they had to another platform.

## Things people did

- **Pete** hacked on his house move. No pics yet, but _soon..._
- **Panda** picked up an [issue](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/88) for the CI on our remotehack site to auto-commit an update to move the date of the next upcoming hack on the following month. Scrum master **Adam** was very pleased. After that, he then attempted to convert his AWS resources to terraform state, _somewhat_ successfully.
- **Joe** made coffee, and then did chores (also no pics!).
- **Piers** updated us on the current status of the [VW Hack](https://github.com/vwhack/esp32cam_stream), and how the Turbo button works!
- **Ben** made us jealous by droping the [route](https://www.polarsteps.com/BenFoxall/5408429-motorbiking?s=32411d5b-cc05-49b5-ae94-85852ae82485) for his motobike trek through Europe.
- **Adam** fixed his terraform code-corpus-api stuff by talking to **Panda** about it...and then later it unfixed itself. But at least he got viper integrated into his go application, so still a big win!
