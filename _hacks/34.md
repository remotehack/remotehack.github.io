It was chaos without our leaders: we met up at 9:30 and said what we'd do, people then hacked and chatted, and we demoed at 16:30. No podcasts were recorded.

## Things people did

- **Piers** blew up a microcontroller for his oil sensor and worked out that he had ground and power flipped (a big no-no)
- **Dan** built a standing desk, fixed his mics sound, and used a new data format to show the current and next shows on TV on the web out of thin air (or from the digital TV guide signal)
- **Joe** was adding HTML and CSS to his TiddlyWiki static site export to make it look nice
- **Hugh** read up a lot about ansible
- **Panda** worked on some websites and solved a complex problem by simply buying a new domain name
