In the face of serious competition from the sunniest weekend of the year, we still managed to remote hack a bit, though the burrito count was far down from our season high.

### Things people did

- Ben and Max polished their new audio recording MVP which was <em>DEFINITELY</em> ready by the end of the hackcay.
- Ruth and Panda worked on taking some user input and turning it into a game of
 life. They got as far as genies and zombies, which is really the whole point of th
e game of life anyway!
- Ryan was investigating backstage, and in the process wrote some yaml and then changed it to yml before changing it BACK to yaml again.
- Adam and Evan outlined their plans to revamp the entire enterprise of technical education (not Ed Tech!), and even recorded a podcast about it.
