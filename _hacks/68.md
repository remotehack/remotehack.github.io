This was a super quiet one, as is tradition, so Adam is just going to rant about integrations with payment providers. While vibe coding a side project and just seeing how it would be to integrate with a service like stripe/gumroad/creem, he chose creem and tried to get the preview environment working. But of course the names of the events sent from the creem webhooks don't at all match what they actually do. There was seemingly no way to cancel a subscription, but then set creem to notify me when the subscription had actually expired, and there was a strong need to "do calculations", the avoidance of which was the entire point of integrating with a merchant of record in the first place.

Anyway, creem was still super cool, but the entire thing basically got descoped for go-live because it was sucking up a billion hours a day and just wasn't worth it. Still a good experience though.
