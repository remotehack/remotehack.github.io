THE 50TH REMOTEHACK!!!!

The best part is that this writeup was done immediately prior to the 52nd Remotehack, because Adam was so awestruck by the grandness of everything the group had achieved, he totally forgot to write up what happened, so here's a very short summary before he writes up the 51st Remotehack summary, which he also forgot to do until just now.

- We marvelled at AI engineer speak from the AI Engineer World's Fair

- **Max** hacked Hayfever

- **Hugh** unpacked some boxes

- **Ryan** read/followed/recommended The Staff Engineer's Path

- We also redubbed the intro to the podcast and released new episodes!

- **Adam** found out that there's a default account-level quota for how many sport instances of G type EC2's you can request (it's 0), so his TTS hax will have to wait for another day...
