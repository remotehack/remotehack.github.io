Keeping the hackdays alive, building up plenty of amazing material for the eventual return to podcasting, we enjoyed a fun-filled and *productive* day replete with unexpected twists and turns, whispers of dreams as yet unfulfilled, though resplendent with the promise of heretofore unrealised possibility.

In short, it was a September hackday.

### Things people did

- Adam continued working on the [mongo dojo](https://github.com/lpmi-13/mongo-dojo), and added a golang process to generate some fake data to be inserted into the replicaset (and then even added a docker option so the whole thing isn't dependent on messing with golang if you don't feel like it).

- Ryan used Blender to generate some 3D diagrams of a 2D house image, which was super cool, though also involved putting it on a world with 5 suns, because apparently you can't just make an image lighter in general without adding a whole slew of light sources.

- Adam was further astounded by Ryan's _other_ architectural [diagram skills](https://github.com/spikeheap/govuk-architecture), and immediately decided it was the awesomest thing he'd ever seen with plans to apply it in his professional work.
