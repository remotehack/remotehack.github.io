Since this is now the record for "most after the fact hackday writeup I've ever done", I may or may not take some liberties...

## Things people did

- **Jacob** got a job doing software...BIG SUCCESS!!!

- **Adam** finally got the [k3s-remotelab](https://github.com/lpmi-13/k3s-remotelab) up and running...now to make it shiny!
