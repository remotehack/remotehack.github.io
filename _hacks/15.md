A midsummer's lull left us with a very leisurely hackday, and well-deserved at that! We took a very relaxed approach and didn't really have a theme or a grand opening ceremony, but we had a lot of fun, and even recorded some video to share!

### Things people did

- Ruth and Pete worked on an in-browser tool to test out simple changes to declaritive HTML/CSS/JS combos, and got it looking very spiffy. They demoed it to great acclaim by all the judges!

- Becky was fighting the terraform, and decided instead of letting it win, she would take a walk to spite it. This plan was infinitely successful.

- Piers continued his long-standing project of hacking the camper van, and got some very shiny number plates fitted.

- Adam started the day with a relaxing massage and inability to actually get his audio to work, then later joined up with Ryan to talk about shared mental models among teams in a hackside chat, as well as a foray into discord.

- As a quorum was achieved, all decided we would switch over to using discord instead of zoom, which has completely free channel-based video calls, and is in general much nicer to use than zoom.

We even made time for some discord song-time!...but then found out that you can't embed mp4's into jekyll, so unfortunately you'll have to join the discord group to see that one...
