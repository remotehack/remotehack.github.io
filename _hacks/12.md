Our birthday hack 🥳 🎂 🍾 🎁. What started as a lockdown-inspired event, we just kept showing up, and have been having fun every month (with a short break in December) for a full year now! Thank you so much to everyone who's come along and made it the awesome time it was 🙌 (and we hope you get good internet soon Mike).

### Things people did

- **Murray** did something musical in C (the programming language…), and we're itching to get him to explain it in a podcast episode…

- **Tom** did some exploration with microfrontends, and was interviewed about it on [a podcast episode][ep43].

- **Jane** said she was going to hack with Access, and look at building up some newsletter templates. She also had strong Pokemon costume game at lunchtime.

- **Tom L** (langford) was soldering stuff BEFORE the hack started, AND told us about his plant->microcontroller->mqtt->etc AND helped out with DNS issues.

- **Becky** updated a sentiment analysis tutorial to actually work, and told us a bit about it on [a podcast episode][ep47].

- **Ryan** and **Adam** cosplayed as Mad Men, by which they meant the Madison Men, and crafted some sizzling copy editing for the remotehack landing page.

- **Pete** parsed some Minecraft saved game data structures to show subsets of entire worlds in ThreeJS.

- **Oli**, **Ben**, **Max**, **Dan**, and **Ruth** formed a supergroup to craft different games to play with pose detection using tensorflowJS in the browser, which are available [here](https://remotehack.space/poses/).

- **Piers** wrote code to calculate the area of timber frames. He also was scheming to do some microcontroller stuff too.

- **Panda** took pictures of his seedling plants via VSCode on a Raspberry Pi.

- **Dan** wrote a script that uses EXIF tags to order files and managed to resist peer pressure to build something overblown and monstrous...but only barely.

- **Mike** was around for a bit, writing a blog post (I’m guessing it’s lamenting terrible internet connections and how long they take to fix).
