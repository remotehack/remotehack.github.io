We had an **old** grizzled vet in attendance, a **new** young gun ready to make a mark, and then Adam thought about the rust **borrow** checker and **blue** his whole project trying to understand it.

...that line started as a hilarious attempted wedding joke, but Adam just kept typing...

## Things people did

- **Ben** held the flame for the old-timer wily vets, opening PRs early and often, and confounding us with verbiage like "multi-camera" that you can, quote, take multiple pictures with. He buried the lede though, since the coolest part was the incorporation of cloudflare workers, and Adam forgot to badger him about all that.

- **Jacob** was a new first-time attendee, delighting us with some halloween-themed game jamming, and being generally enthusiastic and delightful!

- **Adam** only had about an hour to hack around, and decided to attempt to redeploy the newly refactored jq-pilot (now with moar server-side-events!) on cloudrun. It failed spectacularly, but at least now he has an idea of what the billing looks like (ie, about 1 quid/day).

- **Hugh** continued his amazing streak of being the only person to comment in the discord every single hackday, and cheering on the remotehackers from afar...in its own way, remotely hacking the remotehack. hashtag delicious.
