We had our most _international_ day of remote hacks yet, with participants from California and Munich!

### Things people did

- **Henry** joined us from California, where it was 2am! Simultaneously becoming our remote-ist and our most nocturnal hacker.
- **Ruth** showed people her laser cutter, which she used to etch & cut a jigsaw 🧩⚡️. Then she did some hacking with convolution filters using WebAudio 🎷. [She blgged about it here!](https://blog.rumyra.com/2021-01-30-laser-cutting-a-jigsaw-puzzle/)
- **Dimitri** was planning to _learn_ **Rust** by using it to compile **Elm** to **JavaScript**.  Though he ended up helping people find bugs before they'd even written the code that introduced them 💅.
- **Panda** planned to write some software to help keep his plants alive, but instead got sucked into Bens AWS vortex (🌱💀)
- **Max** intended to work on his [LensLok solver](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/96), but instead worked on the Airquotes the Podcast Airquotes _branding_
- **Mike** used NextJS and MDX to build a blog with dynamic graphs in it!
- **Dan** learned some Typescript, then taught people AWS, DNS & service features, and then became an elite streamer by mastering OBS
- **Ben** pulled **Dan**, **Dimitri**, **Ryan**, **Panda** and **everyone** down the [rabbit hole of LIDAR/PCAP](https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben/status/1354475527185313793) and [AWS hacks](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/99). (he's very sorry, but also had a great time.)
- **Alan** got to grips with static site building with 11ty 👨‍💻
- **Emanuil** joined us in the afternoon, and worked on a FOSSJobs site 👍 
- **Piers** told us about his VW Camper hack and chatted about augmented reality, then programmed a microcontroller to measure distances.
- **Adam** intended to [create some statically rendered flashcards](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/95) with nextJS but ended up just interviewing people and getting a PR Merged into Ruth's generative artistry website
