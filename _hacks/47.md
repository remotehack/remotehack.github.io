After briefly considering dropping the free tier of the Remote Hackday and only offering premium subscriber options, it was decided to scupper the whole thing and just continue to lose **massive** amounts of money with this dubious enterprise.

## Things people did

- **Ryan** was scripting a backup of his iCloud Photos onto his Synology NAS now he's replaced the failed disks with SSDs

- **Adam** managed to miss the "regular" session, due to baby dictator machinations, but then snuck in a few hours in the evening to update all of the terraform repos for spinning up veilid nodes in free tier public clouds to include a cron job to automatically update things. It's possibly that just enabling unattended upgrades would have been easier/better/etc, but he did not do that.

- **Ben** did some work under-the-radar on his vanilla JS rebellion against Typescript and added some "tests or whatever".

- **Naomi** joined the channel, which I'm going to declare a _kind_ of hack, and therefore in scope for this recap!
