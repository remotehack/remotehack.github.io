This hackday featured lots of great book recommendations and van chat, all captured in the discord chat, as well as _Lots_ of general non-technical chatter, a hallmark of a successful hackday.

### Things people Did

- **Dan** had some raspberry pi's that did _not_ have golang installed, and then he installed it. And then he _reinstalled_ it!

- **Piers** unveiled the latest updates to the camper van, and discussed how it is basically kubernetes for physical van systems. Though the name "campernetes" was suggested, it has yet to catch on.

- **Ryan** re-emerged to great fanfare, and filled us in on all the sleep he's been having. He tooled around with all of the following, some of them semi-successfully: `minikube`, `skaffold`, and `lima`. Most of the issues came from him trying to develop all this on a Mac, which was generally acknowledged to be a bad idea.

- **Ruth** found great success putting dots on exactly one square of a rendered html canvas, a continuation of her previous work from another hackday. This was easily the biggest success of the day.

- **Adam** was intending to make great strides with putting _all the things_ into a gitpod setup, but then ranted to Ryan for 2 hours about changing tech Ed, and then got roped into watching a terminal show network issues with local k8s development. He ended up picking one application to put into gitpod, but didn't get it configured.
