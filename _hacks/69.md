This was mostly written up by Ben, which was very much appreciated, since Adam doesn't have Claude hooked up the remotehack discord yet.

## Things people did

**Adam** - planned to write up a bazillion prs for our passed hackdays, showed us [moltbook], livestreamed with some inside-out hats while reppin' containers 📦, then used claude code to fix some [slow-jams] issues on the go.

**Ben** - built a [screen-casting] tool, had a fancy breakfast and stole some of Panda's data (that was in fact freely open) about air quality in India.  Claimed that he'd never ever lost a commit, but probably actually just forgot.

**Dan** - very successfully displayed tv listings on his new [trmnl] then had a lovely walk outside to pick up loads of vegetables

**Panda** - wrote at least two prompts 🤖 and built a bouldering route tracking app

**Hugh** - might not have any stairs, but was happy to see everyone!

**June** - Updated [retrace], and showed us how it can be used to break up large commits into.  Became the very first (mostly) successful user of Ben's screen casting hack 🥳.
