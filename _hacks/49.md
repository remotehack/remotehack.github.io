I have no idea how I missed that March this year was our 4 year anniversary, but I guess we can just compensate by having a phenomenal big bang blowout for the 50th remote hack in June.

## Things people did

- **Adam** Finally integrated SSO sign-on (HE SAID WHAT HE SAID) via the tooling at `granted.dev` to assume roles both in the console and direct opening of AWS accounts in a firefox tab. Amazeballs.

- **Ben** was hiking in the lake district and thought of an idea for a lossy qr code thing, which he should totally write on top of the [veilid](https://veilid.com) protocol.
