A spooktacular day, we saw themes both old and new! A return to the hacks of yesteryear, as well as some innovative new directions. Although we _still_ have not returned to our erstwhile prolific podcasting, maybe we'll just save it up for an end-of-the-year mega-cast...

### Things People Did

- Dan updated his IOT hackings to now use websockets from a phone, and do all sorts of fancy controlling of a light. The light wasn't immediately available for comment, but by all accounts it was deemed a very bright idea.

- Max did something with a "hacky pygame-based UI for defunct hardware", and dropped a pic in the general channel, so presumably it all went smashingly.

- Ruth was the most productive member of the group, finishing a tech talk, drinking some exquisite bubble tea, and sewing a skirt...oh yes, and she also went for a run.

- Ryan got jealous of the bubble tea, then switched his hack from ruby to python and everything "just worked" (:tm:).

- Rowan joined the crew, and immediately launched a pitched battle with the Twitter API. After authenticating, the rest was cake, and everything ended up with a nice bot that gives people nice wishes.

- Adam was on call for a bunch of services the previous night, so only managed to close a bar down at 3AM with harlem shaking in a Mandalorian helmet...though it _did_ technically happen on the hackday.
