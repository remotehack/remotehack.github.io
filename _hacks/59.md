Very remote, and very hack.

## Things people did

- **Ryan** put a gutter on his shed, and then got some bluetooth direct-to-swift app wired up, easily the most productive of all of us

- **Adam** started trying to work out how to record a screen and mic audio on linux (read: OBS still too ornery to set up successfully), but then got sidetracked by the mobile view UI of the Nuxt i18n page being crap, so spent time submitting a PR to fix it, and then that got merged and he totally forgot what he was originally doing.

- **Hugh** Hacked on and also hacked wood, with exceptional joinery craftsmanship, and a delightful non-digital remotehack. He and Adam briefly discussed The Darkness, and Adam found out yet another band is actually British.
