This was meant to be the unconf, but we decided to re-schedule and just had a regular hackday instead.

### Things People Did

- Adam and Ben discussed all things Tech Ed, and dropped a whole smorgasbord of links into the #general channel, which Adam will _definitely_ get to at some point

- Max took pictures with a RaspberryPi, to send to another RaspberryPI with an e-ink display. A mysterious third RaspberryPi made things a bit harder.

- Pete worked on a web-based Minecraft block renderer using cool data structures and fancy words.

- Ruth, Ben, Max, and Pete learned about pen plotter apis, and remote-controlled Ruth's Frankenstein mechanical arm thing. Rad.

- Mike confessed that his original hackday never ended, and he's been hacking all along on an [electron substitute](https://tauri.studio/en/) that uses Rust instead of JS.
