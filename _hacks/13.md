This was meant to be the unconf, but we decided to re-schedule and just had a regular hackday instead.

### Things People Did

- Adam and Ben discussed all things Tech Ed, and dropped a whole smorgasbord of links into the #general channel, which Adam will _definitely_ get to at some point

- Ruth, Ben, Max, and Pete got a flask webserver accepting data from remote clients and then drawing on Ruth's Frankenstein mechanical arm thing. Rad.

- Mike confessed that his original hackday never ended, and he's been hacking all along on an [electron substitute](https://tauri.studio/en/) that uses Rust instead of JS.
