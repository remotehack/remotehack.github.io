This was lots of publishing and lots of breaking stuff...but that's very welcome, otherwise we would be hacka-lackin!

## Things People Did

- **Jacob** worked with a books API, which is some tasty bread-and-butter stuff.

- **Ben** completely broke the remotehack site by making the classic error of thinking that cloudflare's DNS is as easy of a UX as the rest of their products, like, seriously, how is it so complicated to just get that product to do what you want? I don't know anybody who got it right on the first trye, and I definitely have been bitten multiple times by this exact thing...I mean, WTF is CNAME Flattening anyway?!?!?! ...but right, this is about Ben, and he was classicly amazeballs, as is tradition.

- **Adam** maybe got his notifications working again from slo-jams.com, but this was most likely an issue with the email templates looking like absolutely slop spam...so that got fixed.

- **June** got [this](https://rvb.stratlan.com) working, but it doesn't seem to be working anymore, but to that I say "HACKS!!!!"

- **Max** published [this review](https://blog.omgmog.net/post/review-mangmi-air-x/) which was niche and in-depth.
