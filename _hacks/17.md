In the midst of a beautiful Summer day, we had a quieter than usual remote hack, but nonetheless, we had an average of 1.5 people attend over the course of the day.

### Things People Did

- Adam got the day kicked off, trying to figure out how to update his Discord nickname for the remotehack server...eventually, he was woke enough, and figured it out.

- Panda jumped on for some chitchat about incident response and general outage training, which was the _other_ thing that Adam was working on. They discussed information that might be nice to include in such a forthcoming (semi-)automated training system, and generally had a very nice and relaxed time not accomplishing anything concrete.

- ...later in the day, since Panda was only available for the first half, Adam was able to work out that his terraform was EXTREMELY rusty, and finally remembered that you *can*, in fact, create a non-addressable EC2 instance in a public subnet...and then updated his terraform config to not do that.
