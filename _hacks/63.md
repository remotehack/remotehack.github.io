A totally forgotten hackday writeup, so let's just freestyle it!

## Things people did

- **Ben** was generating gaussian splats of a mountain bike trail that he rode.

- **Adam** pulled double hackday duty, attending both the remotehack and the Dundee Makers Gonna Make hackday. Once physically on-site in downtown Dundee he tried to register a company for like 2 hours via company house, and then gave up, since the website is complete shit and kept dumping him to the login page.

- **June** found a video about birds storing data and nerd-sniped the shit out of **Joe**.
