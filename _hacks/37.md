This was a bit of quiet one, which is just as well that nobody was around to witness Adam failing spectacularly at crafting trixy `jq` pipelines. Ryan was _kind of_ around, but battling norovirus, so he and Adam chatted about not hackstuff for approx 20 minutes and didn't record it. When _WILL_ the next podcast episode be...?????

...only time will tell

## Things people did

-   Adam was trying to make a particularly nasty `jq` chain work, and in the end didn't get it working, so just removed that particular exercise from jq-pilot so it didn't matter.

> Postscript: He eventually figured out how to make it work at a restaurant in Gatwick airport, so the original exercise is back in business...to the massive relief off all the people who have backed this project on kickstarter.

-   Joe did a lot of bread folding, mostly sourdough. There was also a bit of a breakthrough in the Godot dice escapade, but sure not as tasty as the bread thing.

-   Hugh found an errant filament in his computer and pulled it out. What he was doing inside his own computer, nobody can say for certain.
