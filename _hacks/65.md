Since this was another writeup I was mega-behind on, I'll just share a joke:
Q: Why was the Council of Elrond so reliable?
A: They had Elven nines.

## Things People Did

- **Adam** was able to set up a very simple [website](https://teched.space/) for his new company that does absolutely nothing, but has a royal flush of green 100's on lighthouse (since it's literally just html with inline js/css)...it's also his writeup, so even though this was not technically done during the hackday, he can write whatever he wants.

- **Max** shared [Stellante](https://omgmog.net/stellante/), a Zodiac-themed Balatro-lite. It's some sort of new-age card game that the Zoomers are all loving...or so they tell me.

- **Ryan** did a desk clear and shelf-build hack, and then bass-hacked til lunch.

- **Hugh** and **June** were on hand to cheer on the hackers and contribute praise and affirmations...always appreciated!
