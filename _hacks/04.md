### Things people did

- **Mike and Alan** worked on a collaborative podcast listening site.

- **Peter** added multiplayer to a game he wrote in Python & Rust.

- **Iulian** built an Ubuntu VM and investigated snap packages. He then explained to us how they work and why they're useful 🙇‍♀️.

- **Jane** sewed a _lot_ of face masks, becoming by far the most valuable thing to occur in RemoteHack to date 😷 🙌 [🎵][ep12].

- **Ben and Adam** podcasted[🎵][ep10] and got excited about burritos[🎵][ep13]. **Ben** also unboxed a controller[🎵][ep11].  

- **Adam** created a micromaterials site to highlight exemplar code, linking directly to the source in GitHub.

- **Dan, Ben and Ryan** built on Ben's peer-to-peer gRPC code to create the Lobster Lobbing Spacesteroids game. Ryan got far too excited about using emojis as game elements, and Dan showed us how to add support for Xbox/Playstation controllers using the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API).

- **Ryan** pulled his runs and rides from the Stava API, and [visualised](https://twitter.com/spikeheap/status/1277543399067922432?s=20) how they change over time.
