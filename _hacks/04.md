### Things people did

- **Mike and Alan** worked on a collaborative podcast listening site, which supports dark mode and is seconds away from being fully VC Funded 💵.

- **Peter** implemented a Rust grpc-based server, supporting multiple games/players for an existing Python game 🦊🌳🏝.

- **Iulian** built an Ubuntu VM and investigated snap packages. He then explained to us how they work and why they're useful 🙇‍♀️.

- **Jane** sewed a _lot_ of face masks, becoming by far the most valuable thing to occur in RemoteHack to date 😷 🙌 [🎵][ep12].

- **Ben and Adam** podcasted[🎵][ep10] and got excited about burritos[🎵][ep13]. **Ben** also unboxed a controller[🎵][ep11].  

- **Adam** created a micromaterials site to highlight exemplar code, linking directly to the source in GitHub.

- **James** wrote a backend in python for [a card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Thanks!_(game)), in a way that it could be extended to other games in the future!

- **Kip** joined a live-coding session, and was part of a bizzare chain of VS-Code → ngrok → webrtc dev servers.

- **Dan, Ben and Ryan** built on Ben's peer-to-peer gRPC code to create the Lobster Lobbing Spacesteroids game. Ryan got far too excited about using emojis as game elements, and Dan showed us how to add support for Xbox/Playstation controllers using the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API).

- **Ryan** pulled his runs and rides from the Stava API, and [visualised](https://twitter.com/spikeheap/status/1277543399067922432?s=20) how they change over time.
