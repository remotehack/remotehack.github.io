# [&larr; Remote Hack](/)

## Hack 02 – April 2020

### Projects/hackings

- Adam hacked on better labelling of our hacks on github – Complete success in 5 minutes flat!
- Daniel explored the idea of [dynamically downloading & injecting ui components](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/21) on a page. During the demos, he explained what he learned about shadow dom, web components & injecting scripts.
- Ryan was looking into using Spotify and Slack to make [a social playlist](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/24)!
- Gabor implemented a [capture territories](https://imgur.com/gallery/ybMoPPb) game in Go. At the end of the day, he gave us a tour of the code, and explained some of the formatting/linting/testing options with the language
- Panda & Ben worked on a [distributed game-of-life](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues/23), which could be solved using multiple languages simultanously! They implemented the backend service, and some example clients. During the demo they tried connnecting a real client to the backend which 90% worked beatifully (but 10% crashed everything.)
