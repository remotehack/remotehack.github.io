# Global Code Retreat

## Saturday 7th November @ 9.30am

We'll be hosting an event as part of [Global Code Retreat 2020](https://www.coderetreat.org).

Code Retreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. You'll learn about test-driven-development & pair-programming through a series of interactive tasks.

Whatever your experience, you'll learn new skills (and have fun)!
