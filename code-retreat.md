# Global Code Retreat with Remote Hack

## Saturday 7th November @ 9.30am

We'll be hosting an event as part of [Global Code Retreat 2020](https://www.coderetreat.org).

Code Retreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. You'll learn about test-driven-development & pair-programming through a series of interactive tasks.

Regardless of your experience, you'll certainly learn something useful and have fun along the way!
