title: Remote Hack
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A free, fully-remote hackday that happens on the last Saturday of every month.
  It's very informal and emphasises chill-hacks-ing over actually producing anything
  that fully works (though if you wanna aim for that, that's cool too!)
baseurl: "/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
