# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  RemoTe Hack is a free, remote-only hack day on the 28th of March 2020 from 9:30am GMT.
  RemoTe Hack helps developers and technologists get together to create solutions to remote working, collaboration, and socialising. To go full-meta, we'll be hacking on tools for remote hacking.
  As social distancing sets in and many of us switch to full-time remote, this event is a chance to hack on things that make remote a little easier.
