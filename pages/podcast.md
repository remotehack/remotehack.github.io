We'll be recording interviews with the participants throughout the day. Follow along if you like (the episodes are super short...around 2 minutes each).

NOTE: being interviewed is NOT necessary to participate in the hackday.

## Take part

Either be available on the day of a Remote Hack and make some sort of audible confirmation noise when somebody asks "who wants to podcast?", or alternatively asynchronously leave a voice message at any time here: [Send a voice message](https://anchor.fm/remotehack-live-messages/message)
