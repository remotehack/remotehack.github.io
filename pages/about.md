## Can I attend?

Yes.

Even if you've never been to a hack day, or aren't tech-focused, you're absolutely welcome.

---

## How it works

### Beforehand

→ Drop by [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/wNq8uVvQT3) and say hi.

→ Browse some hack ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues).

### 9.30am, Hello

The day starts with a video call in discord. Join our remotehack server at [https://discord.gg/wNq8uVvQT3](https://discord.gg/wNq8uVvQT3).

We'll have a very informal set of introductions, and discuss what people are interested in working on through the day.

### 10am → 12.30pm

Your time to hack - work on whatever you want.

### 12.30pm, Lunch

Grab something to eat, join everyone on Discord if you'd like.

### 1pm → 4.30pm

More hack time - finish off things, or do something entirely different

### 4.30pm, Demos

We all get back on Discord and chat about how our day went.

If you'd like to share; we'll have time to show demos of what we've worked on.
