<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>Remote Hack helps developers and technologists get together to create solutions to Remote working, collaboration, and
  socialising. To go full-meta, we'll be hacking on tools for Remote hacking.</p>
<p>As social distancing sets in and many of us switch to full-time Remote, this event is a chance to hack on things that
  make Remote a little easier.</p>

<h2>What isn't it?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A competition.</strong> There are no prizes, and no ceremonies. At the end of the day there will be the
    opportunity to show what you've been hacking on, if you'd like to.</li>
  <li><strong>A hackathon.</strong> We'll be taking breaks, and exercising self-care.</li>
  <li><strong>Aiming to fix the world.</strong> Things are pretty dire for a lot of people right now, and If you'd like
    to hack on something directly related to COVID-19 then ðŸ™Œ, but you're equally welcome to build something fun, or
    just learn something new.</li>
  <li><strong>About delivering polished software</strong>. This is a chance to collaboratively explore an idea, see if
    something <em>could</em> work, or learn something new.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will we be hacking on?</h2>
<p>
  The theme of the day is "remote". Add your ideas as issues to our <a
    href="https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> for inspiration on the
  day. We'll come together in the morning and split out into small groups based on what interests us.
</p>
<p>
  We'll meet in our Slack to say hi, and be ready to kick off on Zoom at 9:30am. We encourage you to take breaks, and
  we'll be pausing for lunch around 12:30 (we recommend burritos ðŸŒ¯ to support your local Mexican takeaway). We'll come
  together again around 4:30pm to share our experiences and anything we've built.
</p>
<p>
  During the day we'll be on Zoom and Slack, and encourage you to drop in for a chat. We can also help you get set up in
  groups to collaborate remotely.
</p>

<h2>What do I need?</h2>
<p>
  As long as you have a machine to hack on and an internet connection, you're good to go. We'll be collaborating on
  Slack and Zoom, and there are a bunch of really good tools for ad-hoc screen-sharing and collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  We've started putting together a list of <a href="https://github.com/remotehack/resources">remote hacking
    resources</a>. Feel free to add anything you think might be useful!
